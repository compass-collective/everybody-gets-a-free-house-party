# Everybody Gets a Free House Party

## Overview

The 'Everybody Gets a Free House' Party is a political party and organizing platform advocating for free housing for everyone. It's simple; Everybody gets a free house. 
Our goal is not affordable housing - our goal is free housing, for everybody, forever. You might think that sounds crazy - well consider the fact that housing is already free - what is crazy, and complicated, and hard to implement is the system that first generates, and then tries to uphold the complexities of ownership, rent, and mortgage while enforcing itself upon the entire world through violence. And when I say world I mean everything not just people, but animals, and resources literally anything and everything can be subject to these systems 'ownership' and 'property' - and this is what we want to end. The first step in the right direction is simple - everybody. gets. a. free. house - for free, everybody, house; join us.
